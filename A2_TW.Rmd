While some steelhead trout spend their whole lives in freshwater systems, some anadromous individuals outmigrate to brackish or ocean waters before returning to rivers and streams to reproduce. Each year millions of mature individuals return back to their natal spawning grounds to breed, but are hindered by obstacles or the lack of water connectivity.  Fish passage is a measure of the number of adult individual steelhead that have successfully returned to freshwater habitats to spawn. This analysis invistigates daily, monthly, and annual successful fish passage at the Bonneville Dam in the Columbia River Basin from the years 1939-2019.

### Data Processing
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#Read in Data, Clean, and Add Formatted Date Columns
st_clean <- read_csv("cbr_fish_passage_bonneville_allyrs_steelhead.csv") %>% 
  unite(dd_mon_yyyy, c(mm_dd, year), remove = FALSE) %>% 
  mutate(yyyy_mm_dd = lubridate::dmy(dd_mon_yyyy),
         month = lubridate::month(yyyy_mm_dd),
         day = lubridate::day(yyyy_mm_dd)) %>% 
  select(-dd_mon_yyyy,
         -year) %>% 
  mutate(year = lubridate::year(yyyy_mm_dd),
         yyyy_mon = yearmonth(yyyy_mm_dd)) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  clean_names()
```


### Results: Time Series of Daily Passage
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#Create an Unfinalized Time Series Plot of Daily Observations
st_timeseries<- ggplot(st_clean, aes(x = yyyy_mm_dd, y = value))+
  geom_line(color = "cyan4") + 
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Number of Adult Steelhead Trout") +
  theme_bw()
```

### Results: Average Monthly Passage 
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Create a Finalized Average Monthly Passage Graph
# Find the Average Monthly Passage of Adult Steelhead
st_ave_month <- st_clean %>%
  group_by(year, month) %>% 
  summarize(ave_month = round(mean(value), digits = 3)) 

#View(st_ave_month)

# Create a Plot of Average Monthly Passage
st_ave_month_plt <- ggplot(data = st_ave_month , aes(x = year, y = ave_month, group_by(month))) +
  geom_point(aes(color = month), shape = 5, legend = FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 9000), expand = c(0,0), breaks = seq(0, 9000, by = 1500))+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1939, 2021), breaks = seq(1940, 2020, by = 10))+
  #guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Month"))+
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Number of Adult Steelhead Trout", title = "Average Montly Passage of Adult Steelhead Trout Individuals from 1939-2019", color = "Month")+
  theme_classic() 

# Change the Color Scheme

### Results: Total Annual Passage 
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Create a Finalized Total Annual Passage Graph
# Find the Total Annual Passage of Adult Steelhead
st_total_year <- st_clean %>%
  group_by(year) %>%

    total_year = sum(value))
